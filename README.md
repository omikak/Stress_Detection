# Stress Detection Using Machine Learning 🧠📊

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a machine learning–based framework for detecting human stress levels using physiological and behavioral data.  
It aims to assist in early stress identification and analysis for healthcare and well-being applications.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess stress-related datasets
- Train machine learning models for stress classification
- Evaluate performance using standard metrics
- Build a scalable stress detection pipeline

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Heart rate
- Skin conductance
- Activity levels
- Behavioral or social usage indicators

The data is split into training and testing sets.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
